We are in Unit-4 from Web-16 Batch and students of Masai School

at the end of the unit, the Masai team is assigned a project and the project is based on the technology we learned in the whole unit in this project we used React- Redux and React -Router-Dom.

Where do we feel Difficulties ðŸ™„ðŸ™„??
when we have seen the project our minds got scared ðŸ˜‘ but when we add the functionality and try to visualize and take a deep breath everything is good and the most challenging part for us is to build the cart page and the product detail page as we were building our first project in React js. All tho we managed over all things, here is how it looks.

The conclusionâ€¦<br/>
We know that it was a bit difficult for us to build all the features of the websites with in the given timeline of 6 days so we build all the pages and features possible. We also learned to collaborate with team members. As we all are new to this domain still everyone has done a marvelous job. We talked with each other through various platforms like slack, WhatsApp, and zoom whenever we felt difficulty in building a particular feature. Hence we share a good bond of friendship now.
